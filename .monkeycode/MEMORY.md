# User Instruction Memory

This file records user instructions, preferences, and teachings for reference in future interactions.

## Format

### User Instruction Entry
User instruction entries should follow this format:

[User Instruction Summary]
- Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
- Context: [Mentioned scenario or time]
- Instructions:
  - [Content of user teaching or instruction, described line by line]

### Project Knowledge Entry
Entries discovered by the Agent during task execution should follow this format:

[Project Knowledge Summary]
- Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
- Context: Discovered by Agent while performing [specific task description]
- Category: [Operations & Deployment|Build Methods|Testing Methods|Troubleshooting & Debugging|Workflow & Collaboration|Environment Configuration]
- Instructions:
  - [Specific knowledge points, described line by line]

## Deduplication Strategy
- Before adding a new entry, check for similar or identical instructions.
- If a duplicate is found, skip the new entry or merge it with the existing one.
- When merging, update the context or date information.
- This helps avoid redundant entries and keeps the memory file tidy.

## Entries

[Project Knowledge Summary]
- Date: 2026-08-01
- Context: Discovered by Agent while pushing the wechat-ai-bot project to GitHub
- Category: Environment Configuration
- Instructions:
  - The execution environment injects a git credential helper via environment variables (GIT_CONFIG_COUNT=2, GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0=credential.helper=/app/agent/bin/agent git-credential-helper). This helper only works for internal hosts and returns "server returned status 500" for GitHub, which aborts authentication.
  - To push to external git hosts (e.g. GitHub), strip the injected helper by prefixing commands with: env -u GIT_CONFIG_COUNT -u GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0 -u GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_0 -u GIT_CONFIG_KEY_1 -u GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_1 git ... and ensure a working helper like `credential.helper=store` is used (stored in ~/.git-credentials, chmod 600).
  - GitHub credentials for user WANGjia8613 are stored in ~/.git-credentials (never print the token value in responses).
